    <!-- I could use a character API from myanimelist or some other database online, but I'm lazy. Also, I already have Gemini API usage so I'm probably good here already.-->
    <!-- ^^ probably kinda overkill lol, am just gonna use prompt engineering instead ^^ -->

    <div class="usage-note"><em>Note: the source material and year released fields are technically optional, particularly in cases whatever
        the fictional character is well-known and immediately recognizable just from their name. (For instance, just the name "Walter White" is immediately recognizable as being from Breaking Bad)
        However, if the fictional character you have in mind is (1) obscure or (2) has a common name, they might be worth filling out.
        You must do whatever it takes to unambiguously specify the fictional character you want to analyze the personality of.
